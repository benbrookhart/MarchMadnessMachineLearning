# MarchMadnessMachineLearning
I worked on this project with Nathan Prentiss for our Artificial Intelligence Final Project. We had to use Machine Learning on a public dataset, and we both like sports so we used two March Madness datasets on Kaggle. We used a publicly implemented Neural Network and preprocessed the data ourselves.
